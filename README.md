**Implementation of FedMD**

At the beginning of FedMD, each local model is first initialized and trained on the public dataset.

To save the experiment time, you can download the pretrained and initialized models on [CIFAR-10](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zDMrRcSqe3_nFPV_QZFFCZ1qJSxKk6WN?usp=sharing).

After downloaded, please put the models in the corresponding "pretrained_CIFAR10" folder.
